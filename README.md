# IBM-AI-Engineering-Project

This is a machine learning project powered by IBM and Coursera. In this project, I used Watson Studio cloud platform to train machine learning models that could solve real-life problems. This projects consists of four parts and each part solve a problem independent to each other. <br>

## Use Apache Spark ML pipeline for weather prediction <br>
In this project, I used Apache Spark pipeline to analyze real-word dataset DAX on the IBM Data Asset Exchange. I also trained and deployed several models to predict houtly wind speed from hourly wind direction and hourly station pressure. For the complete code, see <a> https://github.com/Evansun0622/IBM-AI-Engineering-Project/blob/master/SparkML.ipynb </a>
