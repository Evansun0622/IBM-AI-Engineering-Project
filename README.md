# IBM-AI-Engineering-Project

This is a machine learning project powered by IBM and Coursera. In this project, I used Watson Studio cloud platform to train machine learning models that could solve real-life problems. This projects consists of four parts and each part solve a problem independent to each other. <br>

## Apache Spark ML pipeline for weather prediction <br>
In this project, I used Apache Spark pipeline to analyze real-word dataset DAX on the IBM Data Asset Exchange. I also trained and deployed several models to predict houtly wind speed from hourly wind direction and hourly station pressure. For the complete code, see <a href="https://github.com/Evansun0622/IBM-AI-Engineering-Project/blob/master/SparkML.ipynb"> here</a>

## Concrete Strength predictor <br>
In this project, I used Keras to train a deep neural networks that could predict concrete strength based on features such as water, cement, and superplasticizer. I tuned the hyperparameter by changing the number of epochs and the number of hidden layers. For the code, see <a href="https://github.com/Evansun0622/IBM-AI-Engineering-Project/blob/master/Keras%20Neural%20Network.ipynb"> here</a>
